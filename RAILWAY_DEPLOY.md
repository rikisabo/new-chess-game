## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Checklist

- [x] Server configured for Railway (HOST=0.0.0.0, PORT from env)
- [x] Dockerfile optimized for production
- [x] railway.json configuration file
- [x] requirements.txt updated
- [x] main.py entry point created
- [x] Logging configured for production

## ðŸ”— Expected URLs

After deployment, you'll get:
- **Server URL**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- **WebSocket URL**: `wss://your-app-name.railway.app`

## ðŸ§ª Testing Deployment

1. **Local Test (before deploy):**

```

2. **After Deployment:**

- Test with your existing Python client

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues

### Build Fails
